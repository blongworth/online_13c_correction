Use raw OX-I data to assess online 13C correction effect on precision and accuracy over time and between systems.


```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Collect data. Start with one wheel.

Function for online correction.

Get dataset with 14/12, 13/12, and online corrected 14/12. Offline correction shouldn't matter much for this unless there's pre-graphitization fractionation in OX-I.

Summarize: Is OX-I more precise with or without correction? How does this relate to current.

## Accuracy

For this we'll need normalized data for secondaries, and we'll need to back out 13C correction or renormalize to produce uncorrected values and correct offline.
